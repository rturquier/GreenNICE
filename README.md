# GreenNICE

The GreenNICE integrated assessment model is based on [NICE2020](https://github.com/myoungbrun/NICE2020), to which it adds an environment module.

The model is under active development for a future publication. A replication file can be found under [analysis/replication.jl](analysis/replication.jl).
